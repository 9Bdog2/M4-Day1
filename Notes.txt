code . = command to open vscode in terminal 

index.js -starting point 

app is the first component 
child of app 

render -keyword

can create component in two ways 
1) Function = a functional component is simple to write , to return JSX
2)class = a class component is a little longer to write, provide a more fixed structure for some advance features(necessary)

Create folder"Components" best practice
-Greetings component .jsx

const Greetings = () => (
	<p> Hello </p>
)

export default Greetings

-import {Greetings} from ... or just Greetings

Making things dynamic
-Props (properties)
props = {sudent : "wako"}

Class components

import {Component} from "react"

class ClassGreetings extends Component{
	render(){
	return (<p classname={...} >Hello {...}</p>)
}

}

export default ClassGreetings

Classes do more than functions
-can hold a state object(a function cannot)
- in the state object you want to store properties you want to keep track of
setState()
